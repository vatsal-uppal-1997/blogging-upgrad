                Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.[1] Hendrix
                expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured
                before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as distortion
                forever transformed the sound of rock and roll. While creating his unique musical voice and guitar
                style, Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, British rock, American folk
                music, 1950s rock and roll, psychedelic and jazz. Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high
                volume and gain.[119] He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar
                amplifier feedback, and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock.[348] He
                rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the
                low 6th string root notes with his thumb.[349] He applied this technique during the beginning bars of
                "Little Wing", which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This
                method has been described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play
                and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand.[350] Having spent several years fronting a trio,
                he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that
                more than one guitarist was performing.[351][nb 41] He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic
                phasing effects in rock music recordings.[354] Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix
                pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented
                with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid
                vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."[3][nb 42] Aledort wrote: "In rock
                guitar, there are but two eras ï¿½ before Hendrix and after Hendrix."
